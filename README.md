# A python web scraper

A python web scraper built using the Scrapy framework and xpath selectors to scrap investment data for the country of Ethiopia off four different websites.
The project builds database schemas to store a structured data using PostgreSQL database which will later be used by another Django REST API project (https://github.com/faciladev/eic-rest-api) to serve the data.
